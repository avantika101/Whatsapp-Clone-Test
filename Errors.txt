1. Firebase configuration - firebase is not defined
Solution: import firebase in firebase.js! 

2. You should not use <Link> outside a <Router>
Solution: Wrapped <Link> in a Router - gives warnings that BrowserRouter is never used but works

3. TypeError: Cannot read property 'match' of undefined reactjs
-Click on RoomName and the Room Name displayed up there changes. Basically, display chats related to a room
Due to some reason, roomId in Chat.js does not have a default value. Maybe that is the reason for this error
Wrapped index.js app inside <BrowserRouter>
Issue - doesn't display chat name at top. Like, at all. Even after clicking.
Basically that link doesn't know that it needs to route to Chat.js I think.

Added Router, Switch in app.js
Added a Test Component because Router doesn't seem to be working... what?

4. TypeError: Cannot read property 'location' of undefined

5. Router just isn't working!
Oh, it's working
For some reason, defining Sidebar outside the Route path is not working
room id is still undefined

Thank God I saw tutorials of Node.js :prayer emoji:
Problem was in the order of Routes.
OR use 'exact' in the Routes

6. Auth is not complete. Firebase auth is enabled.
Understand Redux, Context API, Data Layers before continuing on this

7. Auth is complete.
